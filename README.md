📊 Online Retail Business Performance Analysis
## 🧩 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a Tata Virtual Internship, where I worked as a Data Analyst to analyze an online retail company’s transactional data and generate insights to support executive-level decision making.

The objective was to help the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) and CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) understand:

What drives revenue

Which markets and customers perform best

How sales vary over time

Where future business expansion opportunities exist

The analysis focuses on business performance, customer behavior, and regional demand using cleaned transactional data.

The company is performing well but wants deeper clarity on:

Revenue trends and seasonality

High-performing countries and customers

Demand distribution across regions

Strategic planning for the next year

Both marketing and operational perspectives were considered to align insights with leadership goals.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Power BI – Data cleaning and dashboards

Excel – Initial data validation and checks
## 🏢 Business Context
  The company is performing well but wants deeper clarity on:

Revenue trends and seasonality

Both marketing and operational perspectives were considered to align insights with leadership goals.
## 🎯 Business Objectives

## 🧹Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy:

Removed records where Quantity < 1

Removed records where Unit Price ≤ 0

Filtered out invalid and return transactions

Ensured only valid sales data was used for analysis

This step was critical to avoid misleading revenue and demand insights.
