📊 ONLINE RETAIL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
## 🧩 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a Tata Virtual Internship, where I worked as a Data Analyst to analyze an online retail company’s transactional data and generate insights to support executive-level decision making.

The objective was to help the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) and CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) understand:

• What drives revenue  
• Which markets and customers perform best  
• How sales vary over time  
• Where future business expansion opportunities exist  

The analysis focuses on business performance, customer behavior, and regional demand using cleaned transactional data.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Power BI – Data cleaning and dashboards

Excel – Initial data validation and checks
## 🏢 Business Context
The company is performing well but wants deeper clarity on:

➤ Revenue trends and seasonality  
➤ High-performing countries and customers  
➤ Demand distribution across regions  
➤ Strategic planning for the next year  

Both marketing and operational perspectives were considered to align insights with leadership goals.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

✦ Analyze monthly revenue trends  
✦ Identify top-performing countries and customers  
✦ Understand product demand by region  
✦ Support data-driven decisions for business expansion  


## 🧹Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy:

▸ Removed records where Quantity < 1  
▸ Removed records where Unit Price ≤ 0  
▸ Filtered out invalid and return transactions  
▸ Ensured only valid sales data was used for analysis  
This step was critical to avoid misleading revenue and demand insights.
